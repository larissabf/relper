# relper

The goal of relper is to provide miscellaneous functions to assist in data cleaning and preparation

## Installation

You can install the developer version of relper from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("vbfelix/relper")
```

## ggplot2 functions

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
plot <- 
ggplot(mtcars,aes(drat,hp))+
  geom_point()

plot
```

### theme_x

```{r}
plot + theme_x()
```

### theme_y

```{r}
plot + theme_y()
```

### theme_x

```{r}
plot + theme_map()
```


## metrics

```{r}

x <- rexp(20,.5)

x

```


### Coefficient of Variation (CV)

```{r}

#raw
cv(x, perc = F)

#%
cv(x, perc = T)

```

### Harmonic mean

```{r}

harmonic_mean(x)

```


## Other

### Area under the curve

```{r}
x <- seq(-3,3,l = 100)
y <- dnorm(x)
plot(x,y)
```


```{r}
auc(x,y)
```
